# Figures

This directory contains **static visual assets** used across Stamp documentation and repository presentation.

## Contents

### `STAMP_BANNER.png`

The canonical banner image for the Stamp project.  
Used in:

- Root `README.md`
- Documentation headers
- External previews and repository listings

This asset is **presentation-only** and has no effect on validation, diagnostics, or execution semantics.

## Governance Notes

- Figure files are **not governed artifacts**
- No metadata validation is applied
- Files are excluded from discovery and validation workflows

They exist solely for human-facing documentation and visual identity.
